# Data Structures and Algorithm
The following project is being developed to implement different data structures and algorithm using python
## Graphs
Based on classes Node and Edges.
- Node: stores its value
- Edge: stores its destiny Node and the edge value
Implemented using adjancency list as a dictionary.
Following algorithm have been implemented:
1) Dijkstra
2) Kruskal - using path compression
3) TODO: Prim
